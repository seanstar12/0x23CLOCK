### 0x23Clock

This was programmed // stolen from http://www.jacopocolo.com/hexclock/# and converted into a chorme extension.

### Features
Fullscreen Toggle: press 'f';

### More To Come
Probably not much. Maybe the date, or a size option. I really only did this so I can trigger it on my work computer as a screensaver.
